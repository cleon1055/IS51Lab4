This program allows a user 3 guesses to select the correct answer of the given question.
The question is "What is the capitol of California?" and the answer is "Sacramento". 

The program sets tries = to 3 and then loops to iterate 3 times. For each loop iterartion, 
the user is asked for the answer (user input). Then based of the users answer, the program checks
to see of the user answer selection is equal to the correct answer. If the correct answer is selected, 
print, "Correct!", then terminate loop with break statement. 

If the 3 chosen user answers are wrong, then program prints, "You have used up your allotment of 
guesses." The program then also prints the correct answer "Sacramento".
